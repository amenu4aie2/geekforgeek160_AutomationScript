ðŸŽ¯ Automate LinkedIn Posts with Screenshots from GeeksforGeeks! ðŸš€

I recently created a Tampermonkey script to automate posting summaries of GeeksforGeeks problems to LinkedIn. It even captures a screenshot of the problem page! Here's what it does:
ðŸ”¹ Fetches the problem title, description, and tags.
ðŸ”¹ Captures a screenshot using html2canvas.
ðŸ”¹ Uploads the screenshot to LinkedIn using its API.
ðŸ”¹ Creates a LinkedIn post with structured content and hashtags.

ðŸ’¡ Why?
To save time for developers participating in #GFG160 or #geekstreak2024, and to make sharing problem-solving journeys seamless.

ðŸ“œ Here's the script:

ðŸ‘‰ How to Use the Script:

Install Tampermonkey.
Add this script in Tampermonkey and replace ACCESS_TOKEN with your LinkedIn API token.
Navigate to any GeeksforGeeks problem page, click "Post to LinkedIn," and the script does the rest!
